# GDExtensionVStudioTemplate
GDExtension template for Microsoft Visual Studio. (Windows Only)


## Getting Started
Before continuing it's recommended to have VS2022 installed as well as [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and [SCons 3.0+](https://pypi.org/project/SCons/).

Check out the official documentation for [GDExtension](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/index.html) and [Compiling for Windows](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.html) as well.

<ins>**Building the solution**</ins>

1. Clone the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/JustinGdnz/GDExtensionVStudioTemplate`
2. Modify the [addonsettings.json](https://github.com/JustinGdnz/GDExtensionVStudioTemplate/blob/master/addonsettings.json) file for setting up the extension name. check out [More Info](#more-info).
3. Run the [Win-Generate.bat](https://github.com/JustinGdnz/GDExtensionVStudioTemplate/blob/master/scripts/Win-Genenerate.bat) file found on the `scripts` folder.
4. Done.

## More Info
### **Template Customization**
The next information is required for customizing the template.

**`addonsettings.json`**:
This file contains the extension data, such as the extension name. You only need to change the `addon_name` value. **Take in mind that this value is important for everyting generated by the template**.

Once we have changed the name of the extension we need to update:
1. **`/<addon_name>/`**: This folder contains the source of the extension.
2. **`/addons/<addon_name>/`**: This is the folder where the extension exists (`*.gdextension`) and where it will be compiled to (`/bin`).
3. **`<addon_name>.gdextension`**: This files contains all the extension data that Godot requires.

```ini
[configuration]

entry_symbol = "gdextension_init"
compatibility_minimum = 4.1

[libraries]

windows.debug.x86_32 = "bin/lib<addon_name>.windows.template_debug.x86_32.dll"
windows.release.x86_32 = "bin/lib<addon_name>.windows.template_release.x86_32.dll"
windows.debug.x86_64 = "bin/lib<addon_name>.windows.template_debug.x86_64.dll"
windows.release.x86_64 = "bin/lib<addon_name>.windows.template_release.x86_64.dll"
```

Everything else will be generated automatically.

### **Generating the Bindings**
The bindings are generated on the first compilation, compiling these manually required you to go to `GodotCpp/vendor/godot-cpp` and run `scons generate_bindings=yes build_library=no` on the terminal.

Or you could generate them directly by compiling only the `Dependencies/BindingsGen` project on VS.
